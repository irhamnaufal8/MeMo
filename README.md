# MeMo
MeMo is a simple notes app with SwiftUI and SwiftData. It has the basic features needed to create and manage notes, such as:

- Add, edit, and delete notes
- Search notes by title or content
- Sort notes by date or title

MeMo also has some additional features that can help you manage your notes more easily, such as:

- Color themes to customize the look of the app


## How to use
To use MeMo, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the MeMo app.
2. Tap the "Add" button to create a new note.
3. Enter the title and content of the note.
4. You don't need to tap "Save" button because it's automatically saved (with SwiftData helps)
5. To view your notes, tap the "Notes" tab. You can search notes by title or content, or sort them by date, title, or type.

## Features
